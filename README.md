# RXJava Workshop

## Introduction

This repository contains documentation and code for a RXJava workshop planned for Early June 2017.

## Plan

Petter will create a set of slides to keep things interesting.
We'll make it into a workshop where we can attack the problems that the
participants have already encountered and together try to find what should be
our best practices.

### Minimal introduction to testing

We'll be using the TestSubscriber and assertj in some of the exerecises and examples.
Let's first have a quick walkthrough of testing.

### RX Functions

In this section we'll cover the most commonly used functions and compare and contrast them.

### Controlling threads

In this section we'll discuss the `subscribeOn`, `observeOn` and the various thread pools in RxJava.

### Exception handling

RxJava introduces some new challenges when it comes to managing failure.
We'll explore those here.

### Design principles and best practices

A discussion of some of the suggested principles.

### [Optional] How to write your own operators
We'll discuss this if we have time...
